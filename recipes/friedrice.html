        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables,
            <br> protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large 
            <br>pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried 
            <br>rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with 
            <br>whatever is in your fridge.
